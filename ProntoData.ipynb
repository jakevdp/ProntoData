    "In October, [Pronto CycleShare](https://www.prontocycleshare.com/), turned one year old and released a treasure-trove of data on the 140,000 individual rides trips during the first year.\n",
    "Here I want to dig into this data and answer a few questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- many naysayers insist that Seattle is too cold, too wet, too hilly to be a world class bicycling city. How do these elements actually affect users of the Pronto system?\n",
    "- what is the difference in usage by annual members and short-term users? How might Pronto evolve to be more useful to these groups?\n",
    "- how do Pronto trips compare to trips by other cyclists in the city? Can characteristics of Pronto use give us insight into deeper trends within the city?\n",
    "- Can we cleverly de-anonymize the data and learn about the usage patterns of individual members?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in how the plots and figures below were created, I have made available all the Python code I used to run this analysis. For details, see http://github.com/jakevdp/ProntoData."

    "- While annual members seem savvy to the pricing structure, one out of four short-term-pass rides exceeds the half hour limit and incurs an additional usage fee. For the sake of the customer, Pronto should probably make effort to better inform short-term users of this pricing structure.\n",
    "- Elevation and weather affect use just as you would expect: there are nearly twice as many downhill trips as uphill trips, and cold & rain significantly decrease the number of rides on a given day. The effect of weather over the course of the year is comparable to that seen for riders crossing the Fremont Bridge.\n",

    "## What Days do Pronto Users Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have found above that there are distinct differences in the hourly ride counts between annual and short-term users, and between weekdays and weekends.\n",
    "One way we can explore this deeper is to use [*Unsupervised Machine Learning*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) approaches to try to discover structure in these hourly trends.\n",
    "What I'm going to do here is a bit abstract, but bear with me: each day has 24 hours, and we can count the number of rides over the course of a day to get a 24-component vector describing the day.\n",
    "In this way, you can view each day as *a single point in a 24-dimensional space*, and ask questions about how the resulting cluster of 365 points in 24 dimensions behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, humans are very good at visualizing two-dimensional or three-dimensional data: the plots above are mostly two-dimensional (plotting \"x\" values vs. \"y\" values), but as the dimension grows this gets more difficult.\n",
    "To gain an intuition about high-dimensional data, scientists often use what are known as *dimensionality reduction* algorithms.\n",
    "That is, we'd like to reduce the dimensions of the data from 24 to 2, while maintaining some semblance of the data structure.\n",
    "A very common method for such things is [*Principal Component Analysis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), which is a way of automatically rotating and stretching high-dimensional data to create a suitable low-dimensional projection which preserves important relationships.\n",
