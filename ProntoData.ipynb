    "\n",
    "- many naysayers insist that Seattle is too cold, too wet, too hilly to for bicycling to take off. How do these elements actually affect users of the Pronto system?\n",
    "- what is the difference in Pronto usage by annual members and short-term users? How might Pronto evolve to be more useful to these groups?\n",
    "- how do Pronto trips compare to trips by other cyclists in the city? Can characteristics of Pronto use give us insight into deeper trends within the city?\n",
    "- Can we cleverly de-anonymize the data and learn about the usage patterns of individual members?\n",

    "\n",
    "- Annual Members and Day Pass users show markedly different behavior in aggregate: annual members seem to use Pronto mostly for commuting from point A to point B on Monday-Friday, while short-term users use Pronto primarily on weekends to explore particular areas of town.\n",
    "- While annual members seem savvy to the pricing structure, one out of four short-term-pass rides exceeds the half hour limit and incurs an additional usage fee. For the sake of the customer, Pronto should probably make effort to better inform short-term users of this pricing structure.\n",
    "- Elevation and weather affect use just as you would expect: among annual members, there are nearly twice as many downhill trips as uphill trips, and cold & rain significantly decrease the number of rides on a given day. The effect of weather on Pronto ride numbers over the course of the year is comparable to that seen for riders crossing the Fremont Bridge.\n",
    "- Pronto's share of bicycle trips in the city has been relatively steady since day 1. This is interesting because we might expect the number of Pronto trips to have grown as the year went on, but it seems that adjusted for weather, the number of trips has been basically constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have found above that there are distinct differences in the hourly ride counts between annual and short-term users, and between weekdays and weekends.\n",

    "Now, humans are very good at visualizing two-dimensional or three-dimensional data: the plots above are mostly two-dimensional (plotting \"x\" values vs. \"y\" values), but as the dimension grows this gets more difficult.\n",
    "To gain an intuition about high-dimensional data, scientists often make use of what are known as *dimensionality reduction* algorithms.\n",
    "In this case, we would like to reduce the dimensions of the data from 24 to 2, while maintaining some reflection of the data structure.\n",
